               <h3>Profile resume</h3>
               <p>
               My name is Alejandro Álvarez Isabel, I have just graduated as a Computer Science Engineere at University Carlos III of Madrid. My profesional carreer started at 2021, when I began as a full-stack low-code developed.
               Later on, I took a course of SAP ABAP and MII. Currently, I am working as a software engineere in Indra.<br>
            <br>
               I consider myself an ambitious person with a great desire to contribute and learn to continue growing as a professional worker and as a person. Always looking for new opportunities and challenges to achive my personal goals.

                    In order to bring a new and innovative solution and aid to the investigation of how the COVID-19 virus spreads through the population, I have developed interfaces that allow the visualisation of infection traces between individuals as a function of time, extracting data from a simulator of realistic interactions between people that take into account demographic, social, virus variants, vaccination and many other factors.

                <p class="parrafo">
                    Agent-based epidemiological simulators have been
                    proven to be one of the most successful tools for the analysis of the
                    COVID-19 propagation. The ability of these tools to reproduce
                    the behavior and interactions of each single individual leads to accurate
                    and detailed results, that can be used to model fine-grained
                    health-related policies like selective vaccination campaigns or
                    immunity waning. One characteristic of these tools is the large
                    amount of input data and computational resources and that they
                    require. This relies on the development of parallel algorithms
                    and methodologies for generating, accessing and processing large
                    volumes of data from multiple data sources. This work presents a
                    parallel workflow for extending the social modelling of EpiGraph,
                    an agent-based simulator. We have included two novel parallel
                    social generation stages -that provide detailed and realistic social
                    model- and one new visualization stage. The work presents a
                    description of the algorithms used in each stage and a practical
                    evaluation on a real platform. Results show that this contribution
                    can be efficiently executed in parallel architectures and increases
                    the simulation detail level, representing a significant advance in
                    the simulator scenario modelling.
